# Ddd To The Moon And Back

A sample application to showcase Clean Architecture principles along with Domain-Driven Design.
It was primarily built as a demo for the talk "DDD to the moon and back".
The talk walked through the fundamentals of DDD aiming at bridging the gap betweem theory and practice.
The contexts are based in real examples brought from the daily works of a software project behing the ATLAS group at CERN.

## TODO
